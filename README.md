# Rationale #

* Steps that describe the workflow of migration 3 databases in 3 diferent operating systems, in outdated file formats. 
* *Goal:* generate an unique database compatible with the most current file format specifications.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
     - Workflow with a focus in the steps (mandatory) to migrate some older database (_circa_ 1990's) to current file format specifications. 
* Version 1.0


### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set-up
     - [Windows 7 iso](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7)
	 - [WinIsis](http://biblio1.mdp.edu.ar/index2.php?pagina=recursos/wisis/winisis.php)
     - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (software that create a custom virtual environment)
     - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
     - Google Spreadsheet
     - db3iso
     - [Beautiful Soap](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download): unencoding of unicode text to UTF-8 format specification. A kind of swiss-army knife of encoding-unencoding text files.
